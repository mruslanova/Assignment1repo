### Collaborative Data Analysis 

### Spring 2016

### By Katie Levesque, Meerim Ruslanova, and Sarah Unbehaun


## 1. Information on our 1st repository

This repository focuses on descriptive statistics of the two core datasets, <a href="https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/html/mtcars.html"> Motor Trend Road Car Tests </a> and <a href="https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/html/USArrests.html"> US Arrests </a>. Both datasets are explored through the R Markdown files, MTCars.rmd and USArrests.rmd respectively. Each of these files are dynamically linked to pdf and html output files in order to demonstrate performed results. The output files can be found under the following links: 

- <a href="https://github.com/mruslanova/Assignment1repo/blob/master/MTCars.pdf"> A pdf paper on the MTCars dataset </a>

- <a href="https://github.com/mruslanova/Assignment1repo/blob/master/MTCars.html"> An html file on the MTCars dataset </a>

- <a href="https://github.com/mruslanova/Assignment1repo/blob/master/Assignment1_USArrests.pdf"> A pdf paper on the USArrests dataset </a>

- <a href="https://github.com/mruslanova/Assignment1repo/blob/master/Assignment1_USArrests.html"> An html file on the USArrests dataset </a>
 
## 2. Objectives of the repository
The objective of this assignment is to get a sense of working with R studio and GitHub in order to practice for the final research paper.
We choose the two datasets, as they offered more quantitative information that would be useful in data analysis. 

The descriptive statistics used in the analysis cover:

- Summary statistics (mean, median, min., max., range)
- Boxplots
- Scatterplots
- Histograms
